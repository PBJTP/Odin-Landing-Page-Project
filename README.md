# Odin-Landing-Page-Project
TOP CSS Project

My first time creating a front page that has this much style from the ground up, looking forward to the challenge. I will be using the styles suggested by the odin project to get most of it completed, and once I feel that I have a decent grasp on how to get there, I will begin breaking/adding things on my own

I will also use the example website to create the HTML framework relatively quickly, and then begin adding styles and my own personality once the page begins to come together.
